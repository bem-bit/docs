### API Reference

Bembit's ***API*** was developed following the best standards [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer).

All operations are made by sending *requests* to our end-points , following the ***HTTP*** standards, with ***[JSON](http://www.json.org/)*** encoded body messages. The *responses* can be handled using ***HTTP*** status codes. That allows any app to consume our ***API*** in a clear and simple way, no matter what programation languaje is used.
